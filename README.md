# base-frontend

React + Redux Stack Base Front-End Project.

Install all required npm packages by running 'npm install' from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).

Start the application by running 'npm start' from the command line in the project root folder, this will launch a browser displaying the application.

The boilerplate code uses a fake / mock backend that uses browser local storage for managing application data, to switch to a real backend api you just have to remove a couple of lines of code from the main react entry file (/src/index.jsx).

You can build your own backend api.
